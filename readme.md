## Welcome to Pok√© Happy ## 
It's a really tricky pun .... Pok√©-API... In case you didn't get it...


## üëæ Pok√© Happy ? Another Pokemon useless page on internet ? Yes but.. ## 

In poke happy, you can (for the moment) see pokemons and stats, and get to see them sorted by types.

I'm working on MANY features:

Like an account and being able to pick 6 pokemons to add to your team.

A matchmaking where you can battle with any other user like a real pokemon game.

Add some mini-games, like the famous "Who's that pokemon !" and other stuff.

I just want to enjoy the process of creation with data i liked since my youth. What can be better than pokemon !
